               <p>Alongside its wonderful ocean like colors, Abalone Shell is a protective stone, not least since it serves this same literal function in nature. At times when your confidence seems to abandon you, or you feel unsafe, reach to your Abalone Shell for comfort and guidance.</p>
               <p>
                  This makes this stone a popular one in overcoming anxiety, but also in staying true to oneself â€“ especially in matters of the heart. If you sometimes find that fear and self sabotage is getting in the way of your relationships, this might be the stone for you.

                <h3>AGATE</h3>
                
                <p>Agate works because it connects you to a broader perspective, and it helps you to see the pros and cons of any given situation. This makes it a good stone for those of us looking to enter a new chapter in life â€“ a new relationship, a new career move, and so on â€“ safely and with confidence.</p>
                <p>
                    For centuries, Agate has been heralded as a stone of remarkable balance and grounding energy. Thereâ€™s a great sense of positivity within Agate that means that even the most cynical and world weary among us can find some hope for the future from letting this stoneâ€™s energies in.

                <h3>AMAZONITE</h3>
                
                <p>Thereâ€™s an abundant level of love and healing energy in Amazonite that can help to break cycles of negative thoughts you might be experiencing in your life. In especially pronounced cases, Amazonite can even help to expose and break through karmic patterns held over from prior incarnations and lifetimes.</p>
                <p>
                    Amazonite is often seen as a stone of bravery â€“ apt perhaps, when one considered Amazonian warriors! It can awaken you to your own courage, and help you to take a stand assertively but compassionately when shattering the illusions that keep you living the same mistakes over and over.

                <h3>AMETHYST</h3>
                
                <p>Ever a guiding light to psychic practitioners, and a beautiful crystal for use in jewelry besides, Amethyst is both popular and powerful.</p>
                <p>
                    It can awaken you to higher wisdom and connect you to guidance from beyond the physical world, but itâ€™s just as effective as a stone for physical healing too. As well as soothing headaches and joint pain, Amethyst also has an aura of tranquillity about it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because of this, itâ€™s a good crystal for stress relief, and for stopping your mind from cycling through the same handful of worries over and over again, disrupting sleep and concentration.

                <p>Ambition and a sense of enthusiasm about life all get amplified when the energies of Apatite are let into your life. This stone has a wonderful color that enhances clarity in your mind, too, and it can be fascinating to sit with a piece and look at the patterns formed in its natural makeup.</p>
                <p>
                    Apatite is seen as a good stone for creative thinking, meaning itâ€™s not only good for those who work in media and the arts, but also that it unlocks new out of the box thinking for scientists and business minded people. This is a versatile stone, with plenty to offer all areas of life.

                <h3>APOPHYLLITE</h3>
                
                <p>With its frosty white and cool blue hues, Apophyllite is a brilliant stone for calming an overactive mind. It can likewise help to prevent any excessively energized bad behaviors, like nervous twitches and tics.</p>
                <p>
                    Apophyllite is a stone that is as much about prevention as it is cure, though. It works by bringing the root causes of certain behaviors and poor life patterns into the light. This isnâ€™t always a comfortable process, but is necessary for spiritual growth and entering new phases of soul development. This stone also helps to ease the burden of these transitions.

               <p>
                  As the name suggest, Aquamarine is a stone that is highly connected to water and its healing, nutritious properties. You may well feel as though the essence of life itself awaits you in this stone, so strong can its healing energies often be.

               <p>
                  However, this is also a stone about the tides of change in life.

         <p>
            Aventurine is a crystal thatâ€™s closely connected to the heart chakra, and thatâ€™s where a lot of old sayings about following oneâ€™s heart are born. Yet in keeping with the adventurous sounding nature of this crystalâ€™s name, these energies inspire you to follow your heart with daring!
         </p>
         <p>
            Thereâ€™s a sense of playful risk taking involved with Aventurine. Many have dubbed it the Gamblerâ€™s Stone, believing that it connects you to good fortune and lucky streaks.

            <p>
               Azurite is often known as the Stone of the Heavens, making it a popular choice for those looking to embrace divine guidance and connections to the angelic realm. This is a crystal that helps to open oneâ€™s mind to what a purely pragmatic mindset would regard as impossible.
            </p>
            <p>
               Itâ€™s a stone of faith and of belief in something beyond oneself. However, it also promotes belief in yourself with just as much potency, and it can help you to follow through on vibrant ideas as and when they strike, confident of your success. This stone is also fantastic for clearing away stress and worry.

<h3>BLACK TOURMALINE</h3>

<p>
Like many crystals that share its density and color, Black Tourmaline is something of a guardian stone, protecting you against negative energy.
</p>
<p>
The crystal has therefore become especially popular with people who are natural empaths, or otherwise apt to pick up on the emotions and energies of others. Black Tourmaline forms a strong barrier between you and others, and ensures that you canâ€™t be dragged into drama or emotional blackmail. Itâ€™s a real confidence booster!
</p>
<p>
However, Black Tourmaline can also be used to protect places and other people, the more you learn to work with its energies.

<h3>BLOODSTONE</h3>

<p>
Despite its perhaps provocative name, Bloodstone is very much on your side, as youâ€™ll discover if you start working with it for crystal healing. It can help to alleviate all kinds of physical pain and injuries, as well as enhance effective circulation of both the bloodstream and your spirit bodyâ€™s energy centers.
</p>
<p>
Bloodstone is connected to the root chakra, which is that which anchors you most in physical reality. This is a stone about enjoying the moment, then, and experiencing lifeâ€™s pleasures. However, when used in meditation, it is also a valuable anchoring stone that prevents you from drifting too far off into the ethereal realm.

<h3>BRONZITE</h3>

<p>
While many crystals specialize in one or another of your inner energy chakras, Bronzite is one of those comparatively rarer crystals that speaks to all of your chakras. It brings them into alignment, and helps you to find out which aspects of yourself most need healing and attention.
</p>
<p>
However, Bronzite is a stone that also has a great deal of protective qualities. It helps you to recognize when people are trying to pull the wool over your eyes, but it also can help to activate the stronger parts of your immune system. The dreaded office bug that always seems to circulate suddenly might affect you far less often!

Exploring beyond our physical bodies becomes all the more easy when Celestite is around. This stone seems to many to be a direct line to the heavens themselves, and you can likewise much more simply connect to your higher self under the energies of this stone.
</p>
<p>
Celestite is a crystal that is always drawn to those who are actively leading a spiritualistic life of seeking truth, healing the disadvantaged, practicing altruism and meditating routinely. However, it also helps those who are just starting on their own soul searching to find their spiritual feet without feeling daunted.

As far as transformation goes in life, itâ€™s usually either an ambition of ours, or the events of life forcing change upon us â€“ sometimes with or without our approval! Yet in the case of Chrysocolla, youâ€™ll find that youâ€™re able to inspire positive change in your life with divine guidance.
</p>
<p>
This crystal and its rich earth colors also connects you wonderfully to the natural world. Just as the seasons roll in cycles, youâ€™ll also see the cycles in your own life for what they are â€“ and feel empowering to nurture or break off those cycles according to your needs, too.

</p>
<p>
   This is a stone of truth and illumination, meaning that not only will you see behind the lies of other people, but also stop kidding yourself in certain areas of life too. And thanks to the strong themes of forgiveness and love that run through this crystalâ€™s energies, itâ€™s wonderful for healing and overcoming difficulties.

   <h3>CITRINE</h3>
   
   <p>
      Vibrant in color and also in its energies, Citrine is a crystal that canâ€™t help but inspire positivity and determination. It connects to your solar plexus chakra, which is where the majority of energy exchange between people actually happens, as well as some intuitive insights â€“ or â€˜gut feelingsâ€™, as we often call them. 
   </p>
   <p>
      But alongside strengthening these parts of ourselves, Citrine also promotes the idea of growth. Thatâ€™s growth of an individual, growth in a relationship, growth in financial abundance â€“ anything you turn its powers towards. 
   </p>
   <p>
      Citrine boosts your confidence accordingly too, so if youâ€™ve been feeling on the back foot lately, turn to this crystal to help you get back on track and ready to speak your piece.

      <p>
         Look no further than the very name of this crystal to understand its secret healing power. In other words, Clear Quartz works by bringing clarity to all around you, letting you see into the truth of things. Luckily, when those truths are a bit ugly or hard to handle, this crystal also has soothing energies that prevent you getting too hurt. 
      </p>
      <p>
         Clear Quartz is able to heal the body and the mind with equal fluency, but its specialty is vision â€“ both physical and spiritual. If you have been suffering brain fog, or have a scrambled mind due to stress you have endured, this crystal can really straighten things out for you, giving you a broader perspective on what to do.

         </p>
         <p>
            This crystal also helps you to embrace the challenges that come into your life with a sense of humor â€“ even the wisest of spiritualists know how powerful such a thing can be in the game of life! Dalmatian Jasper gives a spring in your step and joy in your heart, but donâ€™t worry â€“ it wonâ€™t leave you with your head in the clouds, either.

But patience is a virtue, and Dumortierite knows that. Use this crystal to help you see the bigger journey we are all on, and to not sweat the small stuff.  
            </p>
            <p>
               But besides patience, this crystal also promotes peace of mind and the ability to respond deftly to unexpected changes in life. This stone will also expose the relationships surrounding you that are dragging you down, and any toxic influences in your life will find their true colors exposed for all to see.

                  Fluorite is a popular meditation aid, not least since adopting a state of utmost calm and a quiet mind is so important for entering the meditative state. However, you can also use it if you have been having problems sleeping, by placing it beneath your pillow.
